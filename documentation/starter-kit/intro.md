# What's in the Box?

First thanks for purchasing the Eurorack-blocks Starter Kit ❤️ This really helps to support
our open-source project, and we wouldn't be able to continue without you!

The Eurorack-blocks (ERB for short) Starter Kit contains everything you need to get you started
quickly with the minimum amount of effort.

The box contains 6 distincts elements:
- The kivu12 motherboard, on which your front plates will connect to,
- The Daisy Patch SM daughterboard, the "brain" of your module,
- A bag with all the parts needed to solder the kivu12 motherboard and demo modules,
- A Eurorack standard 16-to-10 pins power cable,
- The Drop demo module, which showcases about every standard features you will commonly use,
- The Frohmager demo module, a recreation in hardware form factor of the legendary multi-band resonant filter from Ohm Force,
   praised by artists such as Stuart Price, Grammy award producer, w/ Coldplay, Madonna, etc.


# What You Need

You need a few tools to assemble the kit:

- A spool of solder, we recommend [this one](https://www.weller-tools.com/us/en/industrial-soldering/products/soldering-wire/wsw-sc-l0-05mm-500g-sn07cu35),
- A temperature-controlled soldering iron, we recommend [this one](https://www.hakko.com/english/products/hakko_fx888d.html),
- A wire cutter, we recommend [this one](https://www.techspray.com/platoshear-cutter-5),
- A rubber band, or ideally our dedicated [soldering jig](https://www.shapeways.com/product/5YWPBCD6Z/kivu12-soldering-jig-clearance-125).


## Other Equipments

Of course the gear listed above can be expensive and you don't really need to make such an
investment to start.

There is much more you can buy to ease soldering if your budget permits it:
- If you are working in a closed environment with not much air circulation, a fume extractor
   is something you will want to look into,
- Some safety glasses to protect your eyes,
- A silicon soldering mat to avoid burning your beloved desk,
- An Anti-static ESD wrist strap band to avoid damaging ESD sensitive parts.


## How Much Time Does It Take?

We tested the starter kit with people with different skills, and it turns out that 2 hours is a good estimate of the time it takes to solder kivu12 and the two demo modules Drop and Frohmager.

Now that you are all set up, let's move on to soldering the ERB Starter Kit!
